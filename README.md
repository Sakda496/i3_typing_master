## ❓ Troubleshooting Display Issues

If part of this README doesn't appear formatted properly, here are some things to check:

### ✅ 1. Not rendered yet

Markdown formatting only shows when viewed in a Markdown renderer like:
- **GitHub**, **GitLab**, etc.
- **VS Code** with **Preview Mode** (`Ctrl+Shift+V` or right-click → Open Preview)

Opening `.md` files in **Notepad** or a browser directly won’t render formatting.

---

### ✅ 2. Incorrect Markdown Syntax

Make sure:
- Headings use `#`, `##`, etc.
- Code blocks use triple backticks:

<pre>
```bash
npm install
```
</pre>

Avoid indenting code blocks too much or they’ll get treated like a list item or quote.

---

### ✅ 3. Hidden Characters or Bad Copy-Paste

Sometimes copying from a website or Word document adds hidden characters. Paste into a plain text editor first or retype problem lines.

---

### ✅ 4. Don’t open Markdown in a browser directly

Browsers don’t render `.md` files like GitHub does. Use a code editor or Markdown viewer.
